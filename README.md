pnpm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```sh

## Migrations

This project is using [supabase](https://supabase.com/), which comes with a CLI tool to generate database migrations.
See the [guide](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/introduction) for more details.

A database migration is prepared with:

```sh
supabase migration new <migration name>
```

A `.sql` file is generated in supabase/migrations.

Another is to update the tables in the supbase studio and run [db diff](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-db-diff):

```sh
supabase db diff <migration name> -f <migration name>
```

After changing the schema, it's time to regenerate the types with [gen types](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-gen-types-typescript):

```sh
supabase gen types typescript --local > lib/database.types.ts
```
